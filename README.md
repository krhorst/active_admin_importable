# ActiveAdminImportable

CSV imports for Active Admin with one line of code.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'active_admin_importable'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install active_admin_importable

## Usage

Add the following line into your active admin resource:


   active_admin_importable

The Import button should now appear. Click it and upload a CSV file with a header row corresponding to your model attributes. Press submit. Profit.

## Custom Import Behavior

Need to do something special with the import? active_admin_importable accepts an optional block that will be called on each row, replacing the default functionality ( calling create! on the associated model). The associated model and a hash of the current row will get passed into the block. For example:

```
ActiveAdmin.register Product do
   active_admin_importable do |model, hash|
      store = Store.find_by_name(hash[:store_name])
      hash[:store_id] = store.id
      hash.delete(:store_name)
      model.create!(hash)
   end
end
```

## Parsing Options

ActiveAdminImportable uses [CSV.parse](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.2/libdoc/csv/rdoc/CSV.html#method-c-parse) to parse your uploaded CSV. You can pass in any standard options via the optional param to active_admin_importable:

```
ActiveAdmin.register Product do
  active_admin_importable(
    col_sep: ':',
    quote_char: "'",
    header_converters: ->(h) { h.underscore.to_sym }
  )
end
```
